# Rails templates

### Prerequisites
* Install rvm (http://rvm.io)
* Install your favorite version of ruby (hopefully 1.9.3)
* `gem install rails`

### Usage
* Instead of running `rails new myapp`, run `./rails-template/new.sh myapp`
* Note that this is an opionated generator! It install the gems that I usually use with a new project, installs bootstrap, creates a haml layout, etc. Buyer beware!
